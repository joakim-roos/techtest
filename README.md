# Salongen - A mobile-first Hairsalon app :blue_heart:

A techtest called Salongen using a simple rest-api build with json-server for fetching data.
It's deployed on heroku and can be found [here](https://hairsalon-joakim-roos.herokuapp.com)!

The repo to the api is [here](https://github.com/joakim-roos/hairsalon-rest-api). The api is deployed so no need to clone it :surfer:

## How to install

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/joakim-roos/techtest.git
```

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To start the application in development mode:

```
npm start
```

If you don't see anything at first, the API is probably taking a nap :zzz:
Give it a few seconds so it can start up.

<ins>This application is mobile-first which means it's a way more pleasant experience to check it out on a mobile device</ins> :milky_way:
